Hello everyone and welcome to my first official blog post. This is new to me so I don’t really know how it’s going to pan out but let’s see how things go in the next couple of weeks.

I guess we can start with an introduction. My name is Jhan (pronounced like John) and I was born in Sri Lanka. I moved to Canada when I was 6 years old and I have lived in Toronto ever since. Very interesting, I know.

Blah blah blah Now I’m here posting my first blog article.

You’re probably dying of excitement now. Don’t worry it gets even better.

I am a graduated of York University with a degree in Computer Science and I love building software. In fact, I love technology in general. Everything from transistors, data communications to video games. Everything to do with technology excites me and if you feel the same way then we should be friends. (This is where you add me on all social media platforms)  :smile:

I am also a music lover. I enjoy almost any genre of music other than country…. Yeah, I said it, country sucks. If you can’t accept that then you need to get your ears checked by a professional to ensure they are functioning properly.

Finally, I enjoy learning. Learning about life, love and the universe. If I haven’t learned something new in a day then to me the day is not complete.

I’ll leave you with **Youngr**. His musical style is blowing my mind at the moment and I can’t wait to see him live.

Happy Coding
