Oh boy, its been a year since I last posted here and I lot has changed.

So, 2017 started off as a normal year for me. Still attending school, finishing up an Android app for a friend and applying for jobs. A typical January for a senior in University. Little did I know that my life was about to change thanks to a little company called Amazon.

In February I received and email inviting me to an on-site interview in Seattle. This came as a surprised to my as I didn’t think I did well during the online assignments. Needless to say, it was an amazing experience and got the job! I moved out to Vancouver after graduation and got right to work.

One year later, and I’m still working for Amazon and I love it. :smile:
