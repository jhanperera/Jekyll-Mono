I am a full stack developer who found a passion in solving real world problems using computers and software. I have worked as a software developer for a couple of years now but I started programming at the age of 15. After building my first computer, I knew the next step was to learn how computers worked on the software side and immediately started learning Visual Basics and C#

I was one of 2 graduates who had the privilege of working closely with York Universities IT department to develop new software that would increase productivity and eliminate any human error. All this while maintain a full course load and developing websites for local organizations in my community.

I'm highly self-motivated, fast learner and a strong believer in team work.
